## MCU Description

The i.MX RT1060 is a new processor family featuring NXP’s advanced implementation of the Arm(R) Cortex(R)-M7 core,
which operates at speeds up to 600 MHz to provide high CPU performance and best real-time response.

The i.MX RT1060 processor has 1 MB on-chip RAM. 512 KB can be flexibly configured as TCM or general
purpose on-chip RAM, while the other 512 KB is general-purpose on-chip RAM. The i.MX RT1060
integrates advanced power management module with DCDC and LDO that reduces complexity of external
power supply and simplifies power sequencing. The i.MX RT1060 also provides various memory interfaces,
including SDRAM, RAW NAND FLASH, NOR FLASH, SD/eMMC, Quad SPI, and a wide range of
other interfaces for connecting peripherals, such as WLAN, Bluetooth™, GPS, displays, and camera
sensors. The i.MX RT1060 has rich audio and video features, including LCD display, basic 2D graphics,
camera interface, SPDIF, and I2S audio interface. The i.MX RT1060 has analog interfaces, such as ADC,
ACMP, and TSC.
